**Spacebot** is a [Deta Space](https://deta.space/) app that simplifies the creation of a telegram bot.


## Getting started
- Talk to [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and create a new bot
- Set the bot's name, picture and description as you wish
- Open the app and paste the bot token
- Define responses for any command (such as /start, /help, etc)
- Click on "save" and wait for the webhook to be set
- Enjoy your bot!

## Contributing
Feel free to open any issue or pull request! The app uses [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) on the backend and HTML/CSS/JS on the frontend, and the code is slightly commented. You can also [contact me](https://t.me/tatotan) on telegram for any question.
